I often forget things and lack consistency in my projects. So I decided to create a list of useful libraries for React development.

Here are some of the libraries I use in my projects:

## eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort

This library is used to sort imports in a file.

Installation:

```bash
yarn add -D eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort
```

Usage:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["simple-import-sort"],
  "rules": {
    "simple-import-sort/imports": "error",
    "simple-import-sort/exports": "error"
  }
}
```

My personal configuration:

```json
{
  "overrides": [
    {
      "files": ["**/*.js", "**/*.jsx", "**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx", "**/*.mdx"],
      "rules": {
        "simple-import-sort/imports": [
          "error",
          {
            "groups": [
              // `react` first, `next` second, then packages starting with a character
              ["^react$", "^next", "^[a-z]"],
              // Packages starting with `@`
              ["^@"],
              // Packages starting with `~`
              ["^~"],
              // Imports starting with `../`
              ["^\\.\\.(?!/?$)", "^\\.\\./?$"],
              // Imports starting with `./`
              ["^\\./(?=.*/)(?!/?$)", "^\\.(?!/?$)", "^\\./?$"],
              // Style imports
              ["^.+\\.s?css$"],
              // Side effect imports
              ["^\\u0000"]
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## clsx

This library is used to combine class names with conditional logic.

Installation:

```bash
yarn add clsx
```

Usage:

```javascript
import clsx from 'clsx';
```

## react-icons

This library is used to add icons.

Installation:

```bash

import * as SiIcon from 'react-icons/si';
```

## react-hot-toast

This library is used to add toast to the project.

```

Usage:

```
