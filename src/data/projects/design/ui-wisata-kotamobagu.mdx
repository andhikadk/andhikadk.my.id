## Overview

This project is a UI UX project for the Kotamobagu City Government, and it is also my first real project as a UI UX designer. I was assigned to create a UI UX design for the Kotamobagu City Government application. This application is designed to provide information about tourism in Kotamobagu City, including the locations of various tourist attractions.
