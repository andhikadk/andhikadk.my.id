Hello, my name is Andhika Dwi Khalisyahputra. I am a software engineer from Indonesia who prefer backend development. I am currently studying at Polinema majoring in Business Information System. since 2021, I started learning the programming logic with Java. Then I learned the basics of web development since early 2022 cause in college there are basic web development subjects. of course I learned it with HTML, CSS, PHP and Javascript.

I possess strong logical reasoning skills and am a fast learner. In addition to my technical skills, I have experience in UI/UX and logo design. I enjoy exploring new technologies and coding, and am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge.
